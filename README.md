# Citizen Scheduler for CIS-498 Capstone

## Project Resources

The csj folder contains all current code for Citizen Scheduler app as it would be setup on a linux server.
The database folder contains the script to setup the database and some intial accounts and 10 rooms (citizenDatabaseScript.sql). The database folder also contains mock user account data and a correllating deletion script. 

You will still need to configure your JDBC settings for the database calls to use the correct hostname of the db server and your db credentials.
